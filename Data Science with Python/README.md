# Practical Data Science with Python

Note: Assessment 3 includes all Learnings from Week 1 to End.

## Learning Outcomes:

- Use industry and evidence-based tools and approaches to transform raw data into a format suitable for a data science pipeline
- Identify scenarios where a machine learning approach may support effective data analysis
- Generate an interpretation and visualisation of data using exploratory data analysis in Python
- Construct and document an experimental methodology for analysis of data
- Select appropriate models, and apply simple machine learning tools and feature selection strategy for a defined data science problem
- Apply professional standards to allow reproducibility of analysis

# Assessments

## Assessment 1 (25%)

Overview

In this assessment you’ll replicate the first few steps of a standard data science project. Using the case study and raw dataset provided,
you’ll need to define the research goal, retrieve the data, and prepare it for preliminary analysis. You’ll document your thinking and
process in a report that you’ll use to uncover the business problem. Your report and supporting materials will also form the groundwork
that enables this fictional organisation to reproduce your same process on similar types of data they have collected.

Grading criteria

- Prepare raw data to ensure it is clean and free of errors 
- Conduct exploratory data analysis in Python to form an interpretation of data
- Document and justify the process by which you cleaned, analysed, and interpreted the data
- Apply professional standards for reproducibility of analysis 

## Assessment 2 (45%)

Overview

In Assessment 1 you concentrated on the first four steps of a standard data science project. Moving further along the process, this assessment
focuses on data modelling. Using the case study and cleaned dataset provided, you’ll refine the business need presented in the case study into
a research question that you must also solve. It is essential that you choose the correct machine learning approach to model the data appropriately.
You’ll also document your process and justification in a report, compare the results, and make a recommendation of which model should be used.

Grading criteria

- Set the goal of the project by refining the business need into a research question
- Conduct exploratory data analysis in Python to form an interpretation of data
- Select the correct machine learning approach and model the data appropriately
- Document and justify the process by which you analysed, modelled, and interpreted the data
- Apply professional standards for reproducibility of analysis 

## Assessment 3 (30%)

Overview

In this assessment you’ll be using different machine learning and modelling approaches to model a different dataset. You’ll need to write and run
your code and then present your solution by verbally explaining your observations and make recommendations based on your analysis. This assessment
presents you with a new case study and dataset and gives you the opportunity to finesse your practical data science skills with Python.

Grading criteria

- Prepare raw data to ensure it is clean and ready to model 
- Conduct exploratory data analysis in Python to form an interpretation of data
- Apply the correct machine learning approach to model the data appropriately 
- Present and justify the process by which you analysed, modelled, and interpreted the data
