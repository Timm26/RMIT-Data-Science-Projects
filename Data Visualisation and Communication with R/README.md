# Data Visualisation and Communication with R

Note: Assessment 3 includes all Learnings from Week 1 to End.

## Learning Outcomes:

- Identify your target audience and determine a data visualisation design goal.
- Use data visualisation and storytelling techniques, including verbal, written and interactive features to 
  help engage your audience and leave a lasting impression.
- Reflect on the major professional, ethical and integrity-based issues that arise during the practice of 
  data visualisation.
- Apply and integrate expert-informed best practice and research knowledge to enhance the effectiveness of 
  your data visualisations and critique the work of others.
- Conceptualise multiple data visualisation designs and determine the most appropriate strategy to achieve 
  your goal taking into account your audience and the nature of the data
- source, review and prepare data required for your data visualisation; and program leading, web-based, 
  open-source, interactive data visualisation technology to build, deploy and disseminate your data 
  visualisations, including applications and dashboards

## Assessment 1 (30%)
### Overview

The ability to tell a compelling story using data visualisation is a powerful way to communicate data
insights. In this assessment you will be asked to research, source, and choose one to three
insightful data visualisations published on the web. You will then develop and present a story using
these visualisations by recording your very own data visualisation vodcast – a presentation where
you will use narration and narrative data visualisations strategies to captivate your audience.

### Grading criteria 
1. All academic requirements are strictly adhered to (Academic requirements)
2. Vodcast presents a compelling and memorable narrative visualisation experience (Captivation)
3. The vodcast demonstrates a clear, logical and effective structure that is easy to follow (Narrative structure)
4. Narrative data visualisation strategies are effectively employed during the vodcast (Strategies)
5. Audio and video quality, clarity of the narration, and quality of supporting resources (Vodcast quality)

## Assessment 2 (30%)
### Overview

Critiquing your data visualisations and the work of others is an important skill for evaluating and
improving your data visualisations. In this assessment, you are required to choose a problematic
data visualisation published on the web and use it to identify an objective and audience and critique
its three biggest issues. You will then use this critique to reconstruct the data visualisation using
appropriate data sourced from the web and publish your work in a report.

### Grading criteria
1. The assessment 2 template is followed, and all the information listed in the submission checklist is included 
   in the template (Academic requirements)
2. Suitability of the original data visualisation chosen for the purpose of deconstruction (Choice)
3. The original data visualisation's objective and audience is clearly and accurately stated (Objective and audience)
4. Overall "deconstruction" of the original visualisation. It takes into account how clearly, succinctly and 
   accurately the original data visualisation's objective, target audience and three most significant problems are stated
   (Deconstruct/critique)
5. Quality of the reconstructed data visualisation (Reconstruction)
6. Data used in the reconstruction is relevant and taken from a reputable source(s) (Data and technology)

## Assessment 3 (40%)
### Overview

ShinyApps URL for the final Dashboard:

In the previous assessments, you were asked to find data visualisations designed by others to
create a vodcast that demonstrated your skills in storytelling techniques and publishing a web report
critiquing and fixing the work of others. In this assessment, you will get the chance to create a
visualisation dashboard/application/storyboard that will tell a compelling story using open data. The
topic, data, and the story you want to tell is up to you.

### Grading criteria 
1. Submission is successfully hosted and shared online, meets all the requirements and constraints detailed in assessment 
   instructions (Academic requirements)
2. Data source(s) and transformations selected demonstrate appropriateness, timeliness, reliability, and alignment to the 
   data visualisation objective and audience (Data quality)
3. The submission presents a compelling narrative using data visualisation(s) focused on a clear objective(s) and audience
   (Captivation and narrative)
4. Submission demonstrates mastery of data visualisation techniques and the appropriate use of the methods and techniques 
   to visualise the data, support the overall narrative, and avoid deception (Visual methods)
5. The submission demonstrates a high standard of quality and considers the appropriate use of colour, headings, text 
   (spelling and grammar), fonts, lines, and the overall layout. (Publication quality)
