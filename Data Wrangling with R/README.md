# Data Wrangling with R

Note: Assessment 3 includes all Learnings from Week 1 to End.

## Learning Outcomes:

- Utilize R for data wrangling tasks.
- Perform data validation processes to ensure quality.
- Apply best practices of Tidy Data Principles.
- Integrate data from different structures into a usable format.

# **Assessments**
## Assessment 1 (20%)
### Overview

Data wrangling is an essential first step in statistical analysis. The insights that you draw from data will
depend on your ability to import the data into R and to transform it into a format that is ready for
statistical analysis. In this assessment you will hone these skills by applying the data-pre-processing
knowledge and skills learned in Week 1-3 to a real-world dataset of interest to you. You will locate an
open dataset on the web, import it into R, inspect the data using R functions, apply tidy data principles on
the data and manipulate the data. You will then create a report using the R Markdown template provided
and explain the steps taken by you in this pre-processing project.

### Grading criteria 
1. Import data table, and describe contents
2. Examine data table's structure, reformat where necessary and summarise
3. Create a list & join it with data table
4. Apply subsetting to data table
5. Overall quality of RMarkdown report

## Assessment 2 (35%)
### Overview

To complete this assessment, imagine yourself in the role of data analyst at a brand that interests you.
A successful assessment requires you to generate and pre-process realistic synthetic data
relevant to this brand. You will then create a report using R Markdown to explain the steps
taken by you to perform all tasks and perform some summary analysis of the data.
It is important that the data you create appears to be realistic. Real data can be random and
messy, with missing values and outliers. Therefore, you will need to insert some messiness into
the data you generate using the skills covered in Week 3. In addition, as data are often drawn
from several sources, you will need to generate and combine at least two synthetic datasets.

### Grading criteria
1. Create realistic-looking synthetic data
2. Merge and manipulate data
3. Scan and transform data
4. Overall quality of report

## Assessment 3 (45%)
### Overview
This assignment requires you to apply your learning from across the course to pre-process real-life
datasets, submitted as an R markdown report and an overview presentation. You will consolidate your
ability to write in R, as well as give written justifications and explanations for your processes.
Extending on your work in previous assessments, you will reshape untidy data and demonstrate the
handling of issues such as missing values and outliers.
You will also have the opportunity to self-direct your learning and interests to find unique and creative
ways to wrangle your data. Your work may be suitable to add to your data analytics portfolio to
demonstrate to potential employers what you are capable of.

### Grading criteria 
1. Select, merge and interpret data
2. Tidy and manipulate data
3. Scan and transform data
4. Overall quality of report + Reflective journal
5. Presentation
